# ETC5521: Assignment 4 - Exploratory Data Analysis of Giant Cuttlefish Species

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 4 of the ETC5521 unit (Exploratory Data Analysis).

This project aims to explore the extent of sightings of endangered Australian wildlife (in this case, giant cuttlefishes) in relation to weather patterns and tourism activities. Weâ€™d like to know things like whether occurrences occur in particular locations, times of the year or day, and whether tourists travel to the locations to have a wild thing experience.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand various factors influencing the sightings of endangered Australian species. Specifically, we aim to investigate:
- **Locations:** Identifying specific regions where giant cuttlefish sightings are more frequent.
- **Temporal Patterns:** Analyzing occurrences based on time of the year and time of the day.
- **Weather Conditions:** Examining the relationship between weather patterns and giant cuttlefish sightings.
- **Tourism Impact:** Understanding if and how tourist activities correlate with giant cuttlefish sightings, including whether tourists specifically travel to these locations for wildlife experiences.

More specifically, we want to investigate the following aspects:
1. **Temporal Analysis of Tourism Data:**
- Subset the tourism data to the region that most closely matches the locations of giant cuttlefish sightings.
- Perform a temporal analysis to identify seasonal patterns and trends, determining whether there are periods of increased or decreased tourism activity.

2. **Assessing Ecotourist Interest:**
- Analyze the correlation between giant cuttlefish sightings and tourism data to determine if there is a notable overlap.
- Investigate whether peaks in giant cuttlefish sightings align with peaks in tourism, suggesting ecotourist interest.
- Evaluate if tourists are specifically traveling to these regions to experience sightings of the giant cuttlefish.

By addressing these objectives, we aim to gain insights into the interplay between wildlife sightings and tourism, ultimately contributing to better conservation and tourism management strategies.
